A (hopefully) simple sample application that combines Polymer, Firebase, redux and redux-saga into something reusable. 

The main idea is to create a Polymer Starter Kit based web application sample, that demonstrates how
* Polymer
* Firebase
* Redux
* Redux Sagas

can be combined in a useful way.

Since I'm in no way a Javascript pro the code is probably far from optimal and currently contains a mix of various coding styles.
Mainly because I'm teaching myself on the way and got inspiration from various blog posts and documentation sites:
* [Project Structure for Using Redux with Polymer 2.0](https://www.captaincodeman.com/2017/07/19/project-structure-for-using-redux-with-polymer-20)
* [Polymer Redux Documentation](https://tur-nr.github.io/polymer-redux/docs)
* [Redux-Saga Documentation](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
* [A Guide For Building A React Redux CRUD App](https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/a-guide-for-building-a-react-redux-crud-app-7fe0b8943d0f)
